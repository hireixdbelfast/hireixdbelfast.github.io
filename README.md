Student Portfolios
======

I took the initiative to make a list of portfolios for students studying BDes (Hons) Interaction Design at Belfast School of Art.

The website was generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Reason for using this is because it allows me to dynamically populate the lists by just updating the YAML file, which you can find in the `_data` folder.
